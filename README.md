# Lendly – Neighborly Exchange Platform

Lendly is a community-driven sharing and micro-rental platform that enables neighbors to lend, borrow, or rent items and favors. It is designed to promote sustainability, reduce unnecessary purchases, and foster trust within local communities.

# Project Overview

Many people buy items they rarely use—like drills, projectors, or extra chairs—while others in the same neighborhood might need them temporarily. Lendly bridges this gap by creating local exchange system where:
Everyday items or favors can be shared for free using a credit/points system.
Valuable resources can be rented for a small fee.

**Key Features (Planned)**

- User Profiles with reputation, history, and verification

- Dual Posting System:

- Free sharing (tracked with credits)

- Paid rentals (via integrated payments)

- Geolocation Matching: Feed and map-based discovery of nearby offers and requests

- Trust & Safety: Phone/email verification, ratings, and transparent history

- Community Value: Encourages reuse, sustainability, and stronger neighborly connections

**Future Enhancements**

- In-app chat and scheduling for smooth coordination

- Smart recommendations based on nearby activity

- Gamification (badges, rewards) for active contributors

- Community boards for local events, group buys, and announcements

# Status

-- This project is currently in the planning phase.
